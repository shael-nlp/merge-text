# merge-text.py
very lightweight python script to merge all text file (in the current directory) into a single one.
- process is nondestructive
- utf-8 by default (you can change it by editing the script "settings" section)
- add a single 'space' character between the texts
- text order is alphabetical (file name)
- nothing else is changed to minimize information loss for nlp



TODO: detect file encoding ? merge different encoding into a single utf-8 file ? someday, maybe.
